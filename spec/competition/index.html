<p>This specification, developed by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/opentrack/">W3C OpenTrack Community Group</a>, introduces a data model to support the publication of Athletics data on the Web. This document is based on the <a href="../model/">OpenTrack Abstract Data Model</a> that defines the main concepts and relations of Athletics competitions, including events schedule, competitors and other stakeholders, enabling a common representation of information in this sector.</p>

<p>This OpenTrack vocabulary proposes an extension of Schema.org [[SCHEMA-ORG]], producing a lightweight schema to identify, expose and process Athletics data on the Web.</p>

<p>This Schema.org extension takes into account its current version, and continuing with the work done previously by the specific <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/WebSchemas/Sports">Sports Schema.org task force</a>.</p>

    </section>
    <section id='sotd'>
      <p>
        This vocabulary is in process of development.

## Introduction

This proposal is based on the [conceptual model for OpenTrack](../model/). As described in [the charter](https://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/charter.html) of the Community Group, this model describes data related to Athletics competitions including: Track and Field; Road Running; Race Walking; Cross-Country Running; Mountain Running; and trail Running disciplines.

This model is focus on Athletics competitions, having into account: events; athletes and teams; results; performances; management of start lists; results; and facilities.

This document specifies a lightweight schema, based on Schema.org [[SCHEMA-ORG]] to represent the main concepts and relations about sports competitions, athletes, and other stakeholders as a common representation of information in this realm. 

With the objective of a wide use of this model, the schema is very flexible and all examples are expressed in JSON-LD format. Along with the vocabulary, there is a specific JSON-LD context that will ease the adoption of the vocabulary, even for those who don not have deep knowledge of the Semantic Web.

No section should be considered final, and the absence of any content does not imply that such content is out of scope, or may not appear in the future. If you feel something should be covered, please [tell us](https://github.com/w3c/opentrack-cg/issues).

## Structure of this document

This specification is divided into two main sections:

1. **Introduction** - this introductory part;
2. **How to** - How to use the model and describe resources using OpenTrack and JSON-LD;
3. **Concepts** - describes the key entities and their attributes, including the concrete data model;
4. **Classification Schemas** - lists of taxonomies and value schemas related to Athletics.
 
## Background

OpenTrack descriptions need homogeneous classes, properties and data types to specify values of properties. This work is based [on existing requirements](http://opentrack.run/standards/), and the rules set up by the IAAF [[IAAF-RULES]] and by WMA [[WMA-RULES]]. The core vocabulary is Schema.org [[SCHEMA-ORG]].

</section>

<section id="conformance">

This specification makes use of the compact IRI Syntax; please refer to the [Compact IRIs](http://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#compact-iris) from [[JSON-LD]].

This specification makes use of the following namespaces:

* `rdf`: `http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#`
* `rdfs`: `http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#`
* `ath` : `http://athletics.schema.org/`
* `schema` : `http://schema.org/`
* `skos` : `http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#`
* `dct` : `http://purl.org/dc/terms/`
* `xsd`: `http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#`
* `qudt` : `http://qudt.org/2.0/schema/qudt`
* `unit` : `http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/`

The domain of this specification is Sports and Athletics ([http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sport_of_athletics](http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sport_of_athletics)).

The namespace `ath` is used to indicate the proposal of Schema.org extension.

## Typographical Conventions

The following typographic conventions are used in this specification:


* `markup`: Markup (elements, attributes, properties), machine processable values (string, characters, media types), property name, or a file name is in a monospace font.
* __*definition*__: A definition of a term, to be used elsewhere in this or other specifications, is in bold and italics.
* [hyperlink](): A hyperlink is underlined and in blue.


<div class="note">
Notes are in light green boxes with a green left border and with a "Note" header in green. Notes are normative or informative depending on the whether they are in a normative or informative section, respectively.
</div>
<pre class="example">
Examples are in light khaki boxes, with khaki left border, and with a
numbered "Example" header in khaki. Examples are always informative.
The content of the example is in monospace font and may be syntax colored.

## How to use OpenTrack with JSON-LD

With the objective of a wide use of this model, the schema is very flexible and all examples will be expressed in [[JSON-LD]] format. Along with the vocabulary, there is a specific [[JSON-LD]] context that will ease the adoption of the vocabulary, even for those who don not have deep knowledge of the Semantic Web.

This section includes introductory information for those who are not familiar with the semantic technologies.

The Opentrack model is expressed under the [RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/) paradigm (a graph-oriented representation), so there is more than one format to represent (serialize) the graph of information: RDF/XML, turtle, RDFa, etc. Examples will be represented in [JSON-LD](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/), a JSON-based syntax easy to adopt.

In order to ease the adoption of this set of technologies, this document includes several recipes to help developers publish and reuse Athletics information through these mechanisms. 

### Terminology

* **JSON-LD**. JSON-LD is a lightweight Linked Data format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is based on the already successful JSON format and provides a way to help JSON data interoperate at Web-scale. JSON-LD is an ideal data format for programming environments, REST Web services, and unstructured databases such as CouchDB and MongoDB.
* **JSON-LD Context**. In JSON-LD, a context is used to map terms, i.e., properties with associated values in an JSON document, to URLs. A term is a short word that expands to a URL. Terms may be defined as any valid JSON string other than a JSON-LD keyword.
* **Linked Data**. Linked Data is a way to create a network of standards-based machine interpretable data across different documents and Web sites. It allows an application to start at one piece of Linked Data, and follow embedded links to other pieces of Linked Data that are hosted on different sites across the Web.
* **IRI (Internationalized Resource Identifier)**. An IRI is something like a unique web address (http://example.org/resource001) that serves for identifying resources.

See [JSON-LD Best Practices](https://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld-api-best-practices/#terminology) for more information.

### Filename extension, MIME type and encoding

* Recommended document extension: `.jsonld`
* MIME Type: `application/ld+json`
* Encoding: `UTF-8`


### Basic JSON-LD concepts

To illustrate the basic concepts of this Opentrack JSON-LD representation we will use a simple example with the description of an athlete:

<pre class="example">
{
    "@context" : "http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/contexts/opentrack.jsonld",
    "@id" : "http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/athlete/001Farah.jsonld",
    "@type" : "Athlete",
    "name" : "Mohamed Muktar Jama Farah",
    "familyName" : "Farah",
    "givenName" : "Mohamed Muktar Jama",
    "alternateName" : "Mo Farah",
    "url" : "http://www.mofarah.com",
    "gender" : "Male" ,
    "birthDate" : "1983-04-23",
    "image" : "https://example.com/260px-MoPodiumRio2016.png",
    "club" : "http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/club/NEB.jsonld"
} 
</pre>

There are there keywords that should be always included in our documents: `@context`, `@type` and `@id`. The rest of the **properties are optional**. 

In case a property value is unknown, the pair key:value will be omitted. 

#### @context

RDF resources (concepts, classes, properties, etc.) are identified by IRIs. For instance, the property `name` used in the example above is identified by `http://schema.org/name`. JSON-LD contexts define keys used within the document can have unambigious meaning, as they bind to the IRIs which describe their meaning.

By specifying 
<pre>
    "@context" : "http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/contexts/opentrack.jsonld"
</pre>

we indicate the context of the document, that is defined in [the linked document](http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/contexts/opentrack.jsonld). So we can use the keys of the context as a simplification for the representation. 

#### @type

`@type` indicates the class of the resource being described. In this example, the resource is an `Athlete` (the context maps `Athlete` to the IRI `http://purl.org/athletics#Athlete`, but we don't care about this now).

* We should include always the type to the object we are describing. 
* In case the resource would have more than a type, several types may be specified within an array:

<pre class="example">
    "@type" : [ "Athlete", "Coach" ]
</pre>

#### @id

`@id` is used to uniquely identify entities or resources through IRIs. 

When dereferencing an entity related via a URL, the location should provide a representation of that entity. 

<pre class="example">
    "@id" : "http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/athlete/001Farah.jsonld"
</pre>

This example describes an `Athlete` that is identified as [http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/athlete/001Farah.jsonld](http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/athlete/001Farah.jsonld"). The web address will provide information about the entity (the same that is being described in the example). Having these identifiers we will be able to refer this entity from other entity descriptions or documents.

Using this mechanism, we can enrich descriptions just linking our descriptions with other IRIs that already identify resources. For instance, the athlete is affiliated to a club:

<pre class="example">
    "club" : { "@id" : "http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/club/NEB.jsonld" }
</pre>

That club (identified by [http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/club/NEB.jsonld](http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/club/NEB.jsonld)) is described in the same way.

There may be exceptions of JSON-LD objects that **do not** have `@id`s associated. We should avoid this case unless we are sure the object defined is useful only in the context of the current description (i.e., no reusable in future descriptions). 


#### Property values

Properties that describe resources may have values of different nature:

##### Literals

Some properties only may have **Literals** as value:   

Texts:
<pre class="example">
    "alternateName" : "Mo Farah"
</pre>

Dates:
<pre class="example">
    "birthDate" : "1983-04-23"
</pre>

Integers:
<pre class="example">
    "age" : 25
</pre>

###### Predefined Values (enumerations)

Some properties may have **Enumerations** as value:   

For instance, `gender` should only take one possible value (either `Male` or `Female`).
<pre class="example">
    "gender" : "Male"
</pre>

In this case, the potential values are expressed in the context as aliases, so we can use `Male` instead of `http://schema.org/Male`.


##### Objects

As shown above, a resource identified by an IRI may be used as value of a property. 

In case [the resource](http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/club/NEB.jsonld) is already identified (and described) we can link it directly:
<pre class="example">
    "club" : { "@id" : "http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/club/NEB.jsonld" }
</pre>

Otherwise we can describe that resource nested in the main object:
<pre class="example">
    "club" : {
        "@id" : "http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/club/NEB.jsonld",
        "@type": "Club",
        "name": "Newham &amp; Essex Beagles",
        "alternateName": "BeaglesAC",
        "url": "http://www.newhamandessexbeagles.co.uk/",
        "logo": "http://example.org/logo.png",
        "telephone": "(+44) 020 7511 6463",
        "faxNumber": "(+44) 020 7511 4477",
        "address": {
            "name": "Terence McMillan Stadium - Newham Leisure Centre",
            "streetAddress": "281 Prince Regent Lane",
            "addressLocality": "London",
            "postalCode": "E13 8SD",
            "addressCountry": "countrycode:GBR"
        }
    }
</pre>

See in the previous example that we can include descriptions of other entities nested (i.e., postal address).

##### Arrays

Most of the properties may be repeated to describe the same resource. For instance, the athlete may be affiliated to two clubs:

<pre class="example">
    "club" : { "@id" : "http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/club/NEB.jsonld" },
    "club" : { "@id" : "http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/club/NOP.jsonld" }
</pre>
Or: 
<pre class="example">
    "club" : 
        [ 
            { "@id" : "http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/club/NEB.jsonld" },
            { "@id" : "http://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/examples/club/NOP.jsonld" }
        ]
</pre>

### Multilingual Descriptions

String properties may include information about its language, so we can include several representations of the same information in different languages. 

The property will include information about the textual information using a complex object with two keys: `@value` and `@language`. `@value` contains the string, and `@language` the tag identifying the language (using [Lenguage Tags](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47)).

<pre class="example">
{
    "@type" : "Place",
    "name" : {
        "@value": "Berlin Olympic Stadium",
        "@language": "en"
    },
    "name": {
        "@value": "Olympiastadion Berlin",
        "@language": "de"
    }
}
</pre>

### Typed Objects

All JSON-LD objects should have a `@type` explicitly indicating the class of the resource. The Opentrack vocabulary includes several classes that can be used, but also other external vocabularies may be used. 

Classes may be described hierarchically to express differences in the model.

## Overview of the model

The model is related to the competition management in Athletics. By using this model systems will be able to describe, collect, process, store and publish Athletics information.

In order to represent properly the model, the work was divided in two main parts:
1. **Competition Calendar**. High-level representation of competitions, seen as sports events for competitors and the public in general. 
2. **Competitors**, athletes and organizations that take part in the competition.

### Competition Calendar

### Sports Discipline

An <dfn>Athletics Discipline</dfn> is a particular type of Athletics event defined by specific rules. 

[According to IAAF](https://www.iaaf.org/disciplines), Athletics events may be classified into: _Sprints_, _Middle/long distance_, _Hurdles_, _Road Running_, _Jumps_, _Throws_, _Combined Events_, _Race Walks_, _Relays_, _Cross Country_, _Mountain Running_ and _Ultra Running_. IOC ODF [[IOC-ODF]] uses: _Races (track and road) and relays_, _Throws_, _Horizontal Jumps_ and _Vertical Jumps_. [Athlib proposes codes](http://opentrack.run/athlib/build/html/eventcodes.html) to represent disciplines.

Disciplines are described by specific features (i.e., throws disciplines, such as shot put, are defined by *weight*). So, having into account the features related to the competition, disciplines are modelled in this taxonomy of concepts:

## Classification Schemas and Data Types

Most of the following definitions and values for this set of value schemas are extracted from the official [Technical Competition Rules](https://www.iaaf.org/about-iaaf/documents/rules-regulations) published by IAAF.


### Date

Date is represented using the [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) standard: `[YYYY][MM][DD]` or `[YYYY]-[MM]-[DD]`

For instance, 7th April 2017:
<pre class="example">
2017-04-07
</pre>

### Time

Time is represented using the [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) standard: `[hh][mm][ss].sss` or `[hh]:[mm]:[ss].sss`

Example, 2 hours 5 minutes 34 seconds:
<pre class="example">
02:05:34.000
</pre>

Example, 10 seconds, 345 milliseconds:
<pre class="example">
00:00:10.345
</pre>


#### High Resolution Time

Milliseconds should be enough to represent all time measurements in Athletics according to IAAF's rules [[IAAF-RULES]]. In the case of timing systems capturing higher resolution of time, values must be represented as quantified values using the Space and Time Units Vocabulary [[QUDT-SPACETIME]]. Editors may indicate the magnitude as a numeric value and the kind of the quantity (unit). Any unit of measurement may be used (hour, second, millisecond, etc.), but *it is recommended using the 'second'* (s), as it is the base unit of time in the International System of Units (SI).


Example, 10 seconds, 3454 microseconds:
<pre class="example">
{
    "@type" : "QuantitativeValue",
    "qudt:numericValue" : "10.3454",
    "qudt:unit" : "unit:SEC" 
}
</pre>


### DateTime

DateTime is represented using the [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) standard: `&lt;date&gt;T&lt;time&gt;`

Time can include the timezone `&lt;time&gt;¬±[hh]:[mm]`.

For instance, 7th April 2017 at 4:45 am (UTC+1):
<pre class="example">
2017-04-07T04:45:00.000+01:00
</pre>

### Distance

Distances and heights must be represented by a quantified value, expressing the magnitude and kind of a quantity (unit). Values will be expressed as a numeric value (decimal or integer) and a measurement code. It is recommended using the UN/CEFACT Common Codes [[UNECE-CODES]] for Codes for Units of Measurement used in the International Trade. 

*It is recommended using the 'metre'* (m), as it is the base unit of time in the International System of Units (SI). Exceptionally, distance and height may be also represented using other units such as 'mile' (statute mile).

* Metre: `MTR`
* Mile: `SMI`

<pre class="example">
{
    "@type" : "QuantitativeValue",
    "value" : "2.20",
    "unitCode" : "MTR"
}
</pre>

Other unit codes may be used if needed. Check and select the correspondent code from the [UN/CEFACT Common Codes](../references/rec20_Rev9e_2014.xls).


### Mass

Mass must be represented by a quantified value, expressing the magnitude and kind of a quantity (unit). Values will be expressed as a numeric value (decimal or integer) and a measurement code. It is recommended using the UN/CEFACT Common Codes [[UNECE-CODES]] for Codes for Units of Measurement used in the International Trade. 

*It is recommended using the 'kilogram'* (kg), as it is the base unit of mass in the International System of Units (SI).

* Kilogram (kg): `KGM`
* Pound (lb): `LBR`

<pre class="example">
{
    "@type" : "QuantitativeValue",
    "value" : "56.3",
    "unitCode" : "KGM"
}
</pre>

Other unit codes may be used if needed. Check and select the correspondent code from the [UN/CEFACT Common Codes](../references/rec20_Rev9e_2014.xls).

| 100+ | `category:V100` | `category:M100` | `category:W100` |


### Country

Each country should be represented by an IRI that includes a unique three-character *Authority code*. It is recommended using the EU [Named Authority List (NAL) of Countries](http://publications.europa.eu/mdr/resource/authority/country/html/countries-eng.html), that relays on the [ISO 3166-1/alpha-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1) positions in case the country is present in the ISO standard. A traceability of this codes creation is ensured and historical relationships are also offered.

The IRI scheme of countries is `http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/country/{countrycode}`. The JSON-LD context enables a `countrycode` prefix to simplify usage, allowing the use of the following form:

<pre class="example">
    countrycode:{countrycode}
</pre>

For instance: `countrycode:ZWE` for *Zimbabwe*, `countrycode:ZAF` for *South Africa* and `countrycode:TGO` for *Togo*.

Check the full list of authority country codes at [http://publications.europa.eu/mdr/resource/authority/country/html/countries-eng.html](http://publications.europa.eu/mdr/resource/authority/country/html/countries-eng.html).


### Continent

If we need to represent a supranational spatial coverage (for instance, when defining the `areaServed` of organisations), it is recommended using the EU [Named Authority List (NAL) of Continents](http://publications.europa.eu/mdr/resource/authority/continent/html/continents-eng.html). These are be represented in a similar way than countries.

The IRI scheme of continents is `http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/continent/{continentcode}`. The JSON-LD context enables a `continent` prefix to simplify usage, allowing the use of the following form:

<pre class="example">
    continent:{continentcode}
</pre>

Examples: `continent:AFRICA` for *Africa*, `continent:AMERICA` for *America*, `continent:ANTARCTICA` for *Antarctica*, `continent:ASIA` for *Asia*, `continent:EUROPE` for *Europe* and `continent:OCEANIA` for *Oceania*.


### Competition Status

| Code | Status |
| ---- | ------ |
| `schema:EventScheduled` | Competition is scheduled. |
| `schema:EventPostponed` | Competition will be postponed without being rescheduled yet. |
| `schema:EventRescheduled` | Competition is rescheduled. |
| `schema:EventCancelled` | Competition will not take place (`suspended`, `cancelled`, `discarded` in SportsML) |

### Wind Speed

Like distance, wind speed must be represented by a quantified value, expressing the magnitude and kind of a quantity (unit). Values will be expressed as a numeric value (decimal or integer) and a measurement code. It is recommended using the UN/CEFACT Common Codes [[UNECE-CODES]] for Codes for Units of Measurement used in the International Trade. Typically, in Athletics wind speed assistance is represented in *metres per second (m/s)*, recognized by the International System of Units (SI). 

* Metre per second (m/s): `MTS`

<pre class="example">
{
    "@type" : "QuantitativeValue",
    "value" : "0.22",
    "unitCode" : "MTS"
}
</pre>

Other unit codes, such as knot (`KNT`) can be used if needed. Check and select the correspondent code from the [UN/CEFACT Common Codes](../references/rec20_Rev9e_2014.xls) list.

### Running Track Type

Types of tracks where running races are held.

| Code | Issue/feature |
