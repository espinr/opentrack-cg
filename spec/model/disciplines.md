# Athletics Disciplines


## Types of Athletics Events 

Events can be defined depending on the main target of the discipline: *timed events* for events involving timekeeping and the performance is measured as time; *field events* for jumps and throws; and *combined events* that are a combination of *timed* and *field* events.

Athletics events are represented by this essential hierarchical classification:

  * **Distance events**. Throws (Shot Put, Discus Throw, Hammer Throw, Javelin throw)
* **Combined events**. Combination of several track and field events (heptathlon, decathlon, etc.)
