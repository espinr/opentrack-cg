# Athletics Disciplines


## Types of Athletics Events 

Events can be defined depending on the main target of the discipline: *timed events* for events involving timekeeping and the performance is measured as time; *field events* for jumps and throws; and *combined events* that are a combination of *timed* and *field* events.

Athletics events are represented by this essential hierarchical classification: 

* **Timed events**. Running or race-walking events, involving timekeeping with results based on timed performances.
  * **Relays**. Competition for teams composed of several athletes performing individual legs. 
* **Field Events**:
  * **Height events**. Vertical jumps, including High Jump and Pole Vault.
  * **Distance events**. Throws (Shot Put, Discus Throw, Hammer Throw, Javelin throw)
* **Combined events**. Combination of several track and field events (heptathlon, decathlon, etc.)
