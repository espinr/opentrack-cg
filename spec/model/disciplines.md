# Athletics Disciplines

Athletics events may be defined depending on the main target of the discipline, and main rules of the competition: *timed events* for events involving timekeeping and the performance is measured as time; *field events* for jumps and throws; and *combined events* that are a combination of *timed* and *field* events.

According to IAAF, Athletics events may be classified into these following disciplines:

* Sprints
* Middle/long distance
* Hurdles
* Road Running
* Jumps
* Throws
* Combined Events
* Race Walks
* Relays
* Cross Country
* Mountain Running
* Ultra Running

Disciplines are described by specific features (i.e., throws disciplines, such as shot put, are defined by *weight*). So, having into account the features related to the competition, disciplines are modeled in this taxonomy of concepts:

* Timed Disciplines
  * Sprints
  * Middle/Long Distance
    * Steeplechase
  * Hurdles
  * Road Running
  * Race Walks
  * Relays
  * Cross Country
  * Mountain Running
  * Ultra Running
* Combined Events
* Jumps
* Throws

This taxonomy includes `Steeplechase` as a narrower concept of `Middle/Long Distance` because of the different nature of this kind of events.
